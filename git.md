## What is Version Control?
Version control is a system for recording changes to a project over time, so that they can be retrieved, or past versions can be reverted to if desired.

It's obvious why version control is helpful in pretty much any project. Even if we never intend to revert back to previous versions, it can be helpful to have a detailed history of how the project evolved for future reference and educational puproses for new team members. A version control system also provides us with backups of our data, although of course if the backup data is on the same local computer with the current version, this isn't that helpful. Also, local version control makes collaborting difficult.

Beyond just backups and redundancy, in software in particular, often we do want to revert to previous versions, particularly when the latest version has serious bugs. Given how complex software projects can be, reverting to a previous version without a version control system would be extremely frustrating.

Of course, one of way of doing version control is to simply save copies of old versions. This can get unweildy and difficult to manage very fast. It can also be very inefficient, since copying files reuses the entire file size even though the changes themsleves may be small and able to described compactly. Version control systems help you reliabily and efficiently manage this process, minimzing error and resources used thorugh clever design and storage.

### Centralized Version Control
Another way of doing version control is with a central server that serves as the authority/source of truth. This is a system used by by many collabarative apps such as Google Docs. There is a single, authoritative version of the file on Google's servers, which you must connect to in order to view and edit the file. Of course, you can downaload and save a local copy of the file, but once you do it becomes detached from the project and further edits. It's just a snapshot of the project at one instance.

Clearly in this model, collaborating is mucuh easier. Another advantage of this is that there is now a copy of the file(s) at a remote site which the users are not responsible for. Howevere, there are some disadvantages. Since all edits are in realtime, it can also be hard to coordinate and work on the same section, since people will be constantly writing over each other. Also. while the data is now managed by a third party, we still have to trust that the third party will not lose our data, i.e. like in the local case, We still have a single point of failure.

### Distributed Version Control
Git is a distributed version control system. It allows us to make use of the previous paradigms and their advantages if we want, while also mitigiating their disadvantages. Like the central VCS setup, if we want, we can still have a central authoritative server as the source of truth. However, all the users will also have copies of the full project and thus if the server ever goes down or the data gets corrupted, we can recover the full (or almost full) project and history from one of the users. We no longer have to rely solely on the server or hosting provider.

Since everyone has a complete copy of the project and its history, they can also work independently and asynchronously without interfering with eachother, unlike in real time Google Docs. The main disadvantage of this setup is that it can be more complex and has a bit of a learning curve compared to the previous setups.

### Git vs GitHub vs GitLab
There might be some confusion on the exact differences between these three things. Git is just a program that you run on your computer that will help you manage and interact with a database of your project history. The original git program is a command line tool, and it is free and open source. There are other tools and software written on top of git that provide a nice GUI to help you use and visualize git commands and projects. There are both free and paid version of such software. 

GitHub and GitLab are similar to these tools and software, but instead of downloadoable, standalone apps that provide just a nice visual client for Git projects, tney are services that are mainly used through a web app/browser (although they have desktop and command line clients as well). One of the the main services that they provide is remote hosting for git projects, allowing for easy sharing and collaboration, as well as a bunch of tools for helping to maintain and work on git projects. While this is one of the main services provided by both products, there many other git and hosting related services provided by both. For instance, GitLab provides you with software and tools to help run your own git server if you want or need more control over your data. For more details on the exact services provided by GitHub and GitLab, check out their websites.

### Getting Started with Git Locally
As we just said, a version control system is a program that basically lets you interact with and manage a database of your project history. Since git is distributed, every user has a full copy of this database with the project history, meaning they don't need to have an internet connection to work on the project once they download (known as cloning in git) it. In fact, you can work entirely offline  on your own solo projects without collaborators or without using a git project hosting service such as Github. Of course, you will lose the convenience and redundancy of having your project stored and available somewhere else, but for learning git, a local-only project is a good start.

To get started, we can create an empty folder which we want to become a git project (also called a git respostiory) with `mkdir`, and then `cd` into it. Once there, we can call `git init` to setup this folder as a git repository. We've now created our first git repostiory. It might seem like nothing happened or changed about this directory. If you run `ls` inside of it, it still just seems like an empty directory. However, if we run `ls -a` to view hidden files as well, we will see that there is now a `.git` directory. This is where all the magic that makes git work, the databases that store your project history and related files, all exist. Everytime you use git commands that change the state of your project, the files inside this folder are being modified.

Since the folder is empty, let's try adding a file to it. Either through the command line using `touch` or through a GUI or text editor, let's create a new file named `test.txt`. Git will now be aware that there is a new file created called `test.txt`. You can verify this by running `git status` in your terminal. You should see that the file `test.txt` listed as an 'untracked file'. On untracked file is a file that git can see but is not keeping of track of it in its database.
